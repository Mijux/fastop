## About The Project

Open Project is a software package that allows you to allocate hours. It can be used for project management, for example. But when you have to allocate the same things, you have no choice but to do everything manually.

That's why I've developed this little script that makes it easy to add up your hours, by day or by week.

## Built With



* [Python üêç](https://www.python.org/)

## Getting Started

You will find the steps to setup the project

### Prerequisites

You need python3 and the following dependencies:
- requests
- colorama

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mijux/fastop.git
```

2. Install dependencies

```sh
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Enter your API in `config.js`

That's all ! ‚ú®

## Usage

```bash
python3 main.py [-h] --host HOST --api API (-d DATE | -r DATE_RANGE DATE_RANGE) [-k] -wp WORKPACKAGE_ID [WORKPACKAGE_ID ...] [-c COMMENT [COMMENT ...]] -hs HOURS [HOURS ...]
```

There are several options:

| option name | required | description | example |
| -------------- | --------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| -h / --help    | False       | Display the help |  |
| --host           | True        |  Your open project instance | --host openproject.example.org |
| --api             | True        | Your open project api key | --api <key> |
| -d / --date | True | The date of your time entrie - date format: year-month-day | -d 2024-03-21 |
| -r / --date-range | True | The range of days of your time entries | -r 2024-03-21 2024-04-05 |
| -k / --verify | False | If you don't want to check the TLS certificate | |
| -wp / --workpackage-id | True |  ID of your workpackage | -wp 4 |
| -hs / --hours | True | Number of hours in day on your activities | -hs 7 |
| -c / --comment | False | Comment on your activitie | -c "Write the Readme" |

Options -d and -r are required but exclusive i.e. it is either -d either -r, not both. When you use the option -r you have two choices.
1. Just put one value
2. Put one value per day, for that just add values after anothers: -hs 7 7 8

Below some examples:

1. This will add the workpackage 2 on 1 January 2024 for 9 hours with a comment.
```bash
python3 main.py --host <host> --api <apikey> -d 2024-01-01 -wp 2 -hs 9 -c "Sleeping"
```

2. This will add the workpackage 2 from 1 January 2024 to 4 January 2024 for 9 hours per day with a comment. 
```bash
python3 main.py --host <host> --api <apikey> -r 2024-01-01 2024-01-04 -wp 2 -hs 9 -c "Sleeping"
```

3. This will add workpackage 2 from 1 January 2024 to 2 January 2024 for 9 and 8 hours per day then workpackage 4 on the 3 January 2024 for 8 hours and finally the workpackage 5 on the 4 January 2024 for 2 hours. In this example, all time entries has an unique comment.
```bash
python3 main.py --host <host> --api <apikey> -r 2024-01-01 2024-01-04 -wp 2 2 4 5 -hs 9 8 8 2 -c "Comm 1" "Comm 2" "Comm 3" "Comm 4"
```

4. Like above but 9 hours each days and no comment
```bash
python3 main.py --host <host> --api <apikey> -r 2024-01-01 2024-01-04 -wp 2 2 4 5 -hs 9 
```
